    <Title>Hi, I'm Valent√≠n Ottaviano</Title>
    <p>
      Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm a software developer and entrepreneur
      driven by a deep passion for creating products that resonate with people.
      Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege of collaborating with
      remarkable companies and individuals who share my vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm wearing two hats: as the Head of Data Science at Sylvarum,
      a groundbreaking biotechnology startup pioneering plant
      electrostimulation, and as a Software Engineer at Circclo, a
      forward-thinking startup reshaping the landscape of circular consumption.
